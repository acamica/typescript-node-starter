TypeScript node app starter
===========================

This is a starter project that will let you write node apps written in TypeScript in no time.

Usage:
------

To start using the `typescript node starter` you just need to follow these steps

```bash
# clone this repo (change myapp for your application name)
$ git clone git@github.com:acamica/typescript-node-starter.git myapp
$ cd myapp
# Install your deps using yarn or npm and follow the questions.
$ npm install
```


Features
--------
* TypeScript Workflow
* Unit testing and tdd/bdd workflow
* TSlint before commit
* GIT messages validator using format like `feat(general): Some description`
* Reliable package management using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
* Homogeneous service environment using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Visual Studio Code configuration
* [Editor config](http://editorconfig.org/) for editors that supports it like Visual Code

### TypeScript Workflow
TypeScript v2.3

TODO: explain `npm start` and `npm run build-and:start`

TODO: explain strict rules

        "noImplicitAny": true,
        "noImplicitThis": true,
        "noUnusedLocals": true,
        "noImplicitReturns": true,
        "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
        "strictNullChecks": true,

### Unit testing & TDD

Unit testing is your first line of defense against bugs when you are developing your application, but it's useless if you don't have a proper workflow to run them. With this integration you can run your unit test in a single run or get into tdd mode using an npm script. Also the test need to pass in order to make a `git push`.

Your code is in TypeScript and so should your test files. That way if a test fails it's easier to see if its due to a change in the contract or an actual bug.

#### Why mocha + chai + sinon:
* âœ… It's been proven over and over / Well known in the community.
* âœ… Decoupled test runner from the assertion and or mock library.
* ðŸš« By default it runs all the test sequentially (so it may be slower than others)

#### How to use:

Create a test file next to the file you want to test, using the nomenclature `<file-name>.test.ts`.

You can run your test in a single run by doing:

```bash
$ npm run build-and:test
```

Or you can enter in a `Test Driven Development` mode, so whenever you change a file it gets compiled and the test are executed.

```bash
$ npm run tdd
```

ðŸŒŸ You can install a terminal notifier to receive growl messages with the test execution results.

```bash
# How to install growl messages on your platform
# Mac OS X (Darwin):
$ sudo gem install terminal-notifier

# Ubuntu (Linux):
$ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin
```

TODO: add ci

TODO: Add a gif of growl messages

TODO: See if we can add a way to create test in a `test` directory as well.

#### How to remove:


```bash
$ yarn remove -D mocha @types/mocha chai @types/chai sinon
```

In the `package.json` remove the scripts "test", "watch:test" and "tdd" and if no other script uses it, remove `npm-run-all` as a dependency.

### Docker

If the node app you are trying to build is intended to be a service of some sort (micro or monolithic) you may want to guarantee that it runs in reliable environment. Using Docker we can specify the version of `os`, `node` and others to reduce the difference between dev, prod and ci environments.

If you want to learn more about Docker you can try [this course (in spanish)](https://www.acamica.com/cursos/128/introduccion-a-docker). To remove docker from the project just delete the `Dockerfile`.

TODO: add reference for an english course on docker

You can build your docker images using the command

```bash
$ npm run docker:build
```

The images created by the build will be tagged with the name and version of your project as specified in the package.json. You can run the image using docker directly or you can run it as an `npm script`.

```bash
$ npm run docker:run
```

TODO: Implement docker:push

If you need to modify the way your image is built, runned or published, you can edit the `docker:*` scripts
located in the package.json.

Notice that the `Dockerfile` takes advantage of the `layers cache`, if you modify the code in the `src` folder it won't run `yarn install`, it will only build the typescript code. If you change the `package.json` or `yarn.lock` it will install deps and then build.


### Visual Studio Code configuration

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you have some things pre-configured under the `.vscode` folder:

* You can [run or debug your *tests*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) by selecting the `Run tests` [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
* You can [run or debug your *program*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) by selecting the `Launch Program` [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
* You can replay the run by pressing F5.
* When editing typescript files you get `fix lint on save`.
* You can build the project by doing `âŒ˜â‡§B`.
* Build and tag a docker image using the `docker-build` [task](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks).
* Build, tag and run a docker image using the `Build and Launch Docker` [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).

TODO:
-----
* Add package deps upgrade tool
* Add automatic Changelog
* Add automatic semver
* Add CI
* Add doc generation
* Add testing coverage
* Add readme badges
* Improve docker integration to build faster
* Improve tdd watch mode
* Maybe: Create branch with FRP using rx and ramda
* Maybe: Create branch with express and knex
* Maybe: Create branch with CLI using commander or similar
